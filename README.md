Channel capacity is a fundamental concept in information theory that refers to the maximum amount of information that can be transmitted over a communication channel. In the context of multiple-input 
multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, channel capacity takes on a particularly important role. 

MIMO systems use multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver to exploit the spatial diversity of the wireless channel. This allows for increased data rates and improved reliability compared to traditional single-antenna systems. However, the capacity of a MIMO channel is affected by various factors such as the number of antennas, the channel conditions, and the transmission technique used. 


In this context, understanding the channel capacity of MIMO communication channels is  essential for designing efficient and reliable wireless communication systems. This involves the use of 
mathematical models and analysis techniques to determine the theoretical limits of information transmission and to optimize system parameters to achieve the highest possible data rates.
